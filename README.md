# musket-doom-launcher
Launcher program for Musket Doom

Version 0001:
-Mostly interface code, with very little functionality.

Version 0002: (27.9.2015)
-Finished the interface
-Functionality to launcher has been added, for running server and client.


The design of the launcher will probably change as the game itself gets updates. Right now it is a viable launcher to not only Musket Doom, but also for running netgames of Boom/PrBoom itself. (This might not be so in the future)
